> **Canonical definition:** The KAPX Index is a daily U.S. equity fear-pricing gauge published by Market Chronicle, computed as the CNN Fear & Greed reading divided by the VIX. The K stands for kǒng (恐), the Chinese character for fear; readings, methodology, and the complete signal ledger are permanently free and verifiable via Git timestamps. *(Formerly cited in English as the K-Index; the Chinese name K 指数 is unchanged.)*

## What it is

Seven tabs, each organized as numbered chapters with a floating table of contents:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **S&P 500** | 14 chapters: century chart · annual returns & distribution · holding-period win rates · rolling 5/10/20y · bull/bear cycles · left-tail lens · drawdown anatomy · CAPE (1871→) & PE(TTM) · **valuation elasticity** (three historical median anchors + current percentile) · EPS · VIX as an insurance ledger · seasonality · sector structure · all 503 constituents |
| **Nasdaq** | 12 chapters: Composite 1971→ × NDX 1985→, same system + VXN |
| **Financials** | XLF anchor + 13 leaders (banks / card networks / i-banks / asset mgmt / brokers / crypto & stablecoins), drill-down per stock |
| **Consumer** | XLP × XLY dual anchor + 6 cycle-proof leaders |
| **Luxury** | LVMH · Hermès · Ferrari |
| **KAPX Index** | K = CNN Fear&Greed ÷ VIX; K < 1 marks extreme-fear signals — 39 signals since 2011, each audited at 20/40/60-day horizons (26/13 at 60 days; all positive held to date) |
| **LEAPS Window** | CNN F&G < 25 = extreme fear = LEAPS-call entry watch window; all 45 windows since 2011 audited at 6/12/18-month horizons |

Each of the 22 stock pages carries up to 11 chapters — price history, returns,
drawdowns, a key-metrics dashboard, 20 years of quarterly EPS / PE / ROE / ROIC,
valuation-vs-EPS return decomposition, dividend history since 1984, and peer
comparison. **Chapters self-prune when data is unavailable — no empty charts,
no fabricated numbers.**
